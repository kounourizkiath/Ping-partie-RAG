OWASP API Security Top 10 2023
What is API Security?
A foundational element of innovation in today’s app-driven world is the API.
From banks, retail and transportation to IoT, autonomous vehicles and smart
cities, APIs are a critical part of modern mobile, SaaS and web applications and
can be found in customer-facing, partner-facing and internal applications. By
nature, APIs expose application logic and sensitive data such as Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) and because of this have increasingly become a
target for attackers. Without secure APIs, rapid innovation would be impossible.
API Security focuses on strategies and solutions to understand and mitigate the
unique vulnerabilities and security risks of Application Programming Interfaces
API Security Top 10 2023
Here is a sneak peek of the 2023 version:
API1:2023 - Broken Object Level Authorization
APIs tend to expose endpoints that handle object identifiers, creating a wide
attack surface of Object Level Access Control issues. Object level
authorization checks should be considered in every function that accesses a
data source using an ID from the user.
API2:2023 - Broken Authentication
Authentication mechanisms are often implemented incorrectly, allowing
attackers to compromise authentication tokens or to exploit implementation
flaws to assume other user’s identities temporarily or permanently.
Compromising a system’s ability to identify the client/user, compromises API
API3:2023 - Broken Object Property Level Authorization
This category combines
API3:2019 Excessive Data Exposure
API6:2019 - Mass Assignment
, focusing on the root cause: the lack
of or improper authorization validation at the object property level. This
leads to information exposure or manipulation by unauthorized parties.
API4:2023 - Unrestricted Resource Consumption
Satisfying API requests requires resources such as network bandwidth, CPU,
memory, and storage. Other resources such as emails/SMS/phone calls or
biometrics validation are made available by service providers via API
integrations, and paid for per request. Successful attacks can lead to Denial
of Service or an increase of operational costs.
API5:2023 - Broken Function Level Authorization
Complex access control policies with different hierarchies, groups, and roles,
and an unclear separation between administrative and regular functions, tend
to lead to authorization flaws. By exploiting these issues, attackers can gain
access to other users’ resources and/or administrative functions.
API6:2023 - Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows
APIs vulnerable to this risk expose a business flow - such as buying a ticket,
or posting a comment - without compensating for how the functionality could
harm the business if used excessively in an automated manner. This doesn’t
necessarily come from implementation bugs.
API7:2023 - Server Side Request Forgery
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaws can occur when an API is fetching a
remote resource without validating the user-supplied URI. This enables an
attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected
destination, even when protected by a firewall or a VPN.
API8:2023 - Security Misconfiguration
APIs and the systems supporting them typically contain complex configurations,
meant to make the APIs more customizable. Software and DevOps engineers can
miss these configurations, or don’t follow security best practices when it
comes to configuration, opening the door for different types of attacks.
API9:2023 - Improper Inventory Management
APIs tend to expose more endpoints than traditional web applications, making
proper and updated documentation highly important. A proper inventory of hosts
and deployed API versions also are important to mitigate issues such as
deprecated API versions and exposed debug endpoints.
API10:2023 - Unsafe Consumption of APIs
Developers tend to trust data received from third-party APIs more than user
input, and so tend to adopt weaker security standards. In order to compromise
APIs, attackers go after integrated third-party services instead of trying to
compromise the target API directly.
