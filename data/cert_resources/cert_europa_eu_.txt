On June 6, the Council of the European Union adopted the Recommendation on an EU Blueprint for cyber crisis management.
Born in 2011, CERT-EU is an inter-institutional service provider administratively hosted in the

of our constituents. We have been steadily expanding our cybersecurity operations over the years

partners and researchers from all over the world to ensure we maintain our technological edge
and have access to the best-in-class expertise.
