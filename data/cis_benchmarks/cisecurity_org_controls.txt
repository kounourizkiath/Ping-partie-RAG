CIS Controls® at a Glance
The CIS Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls) are a prescriptive, prioritized, and simplified set of best practices that you can use to strengthen your cybersecurity posture. Today, thousands of cybersecurity practitioners from around the world use the CIS Controls and/or contribute to their development via a community consensus process.

Comply with Industry Regulations

Mapping and Compliance page
for more information.
Achieve Essential Cyber Hygiene
Almost all successful cyber attacks exploit “poor cyber hygiene” like unpatched software, poor configuration management, and outdated solutions. The CIS Controls include foundational security measures that you can use to achieve essential hygiene and protect yourself against a cyber attack.
Translate Information into Action
Modern systems and software are dynamic in nature. By enacting the CIS Controls, you support your assets' evolving needs in a meaningful way and align your security efforts with your business goals.
Multiple U.S. States require executive branch agencies and other government entities to implement cybersecurity best practices. Several of them specifically mention the CIS Controls as a way of demonstrating a "reasonable" level of security.
We use the CIS Controls to help our clients achieve compliance with state and federal cybersecurity regulations. The CIS 18 are prioritized, easy to understand, and extremely cost-effective for small to mid-size organizations looking to prove they are secure enough to do business in today’s marketplace. I highly recommend starting with CIS in building your cybersecurity program.
