Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience
CISA provides guidance to support state, local, and industry partners in identifying critical infrastructure needed to maintain the functions Americans depend on daily.
Critical Infrastructure are those assets, systems, and networks that provide functions necessary for our way of life. There are
16 critical infrastructure sectors
that are part of a complex, interconnected ecosystem and any threat to these sectors could have potentially debilitating national security, economic, and public health or safety consequences. CISA provides guidance to support state, local, and industry partners in identifying the critical infrastructure sectors and the essential workers needed to maintain the services and functions Americans depend on daily.
16 Critical Infrastructure Sectors
There are 16 critical infrastructure sectors that are part of a complex, interconnected ecosystem.
Whistleblower Retaliation
If you work in any of these Critical Infrastructure Sectors and you feel you’ve been retaliated against for raising concerns to your employer or regulators about critical infrastructure, you may contact the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  OSHA’s Whistleblower Protection Program enforces over 20 anti-retaliation statutes that may protect your report. More information can be found at the link below. Complaints with OSHA can be filed
