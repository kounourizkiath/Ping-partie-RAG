Dependency Management
Open source software packages can speed up the development process by allowing developers to implement functionality without having to write all of the code. However, with the open source code comes open source vulnerabilities. Dependency management tools help manage vulnerabilities in open source packages by identifying and updating packages with known vulnerabilities.

Infrastructure as Code Analysis
Infrastructure as Code allows applications to be deployed reliably to a consistent environment. This not only ensures that infrastructure is consistently hardened, but also provides an opportunity to statically and dynamically analyse infrastructure definitions for vulnerable dependencies, hard-coded secrets, insecure configuration and unintentional changes in security configuration. The following tools facilitate this analysis.
- Scan Terraform, AWS CloudFormation and Kubernetes templates for insecure configuration.
- Find security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations early in the development cycle.
- Find misconfiguration both in infrastructure as well as apps as early as commit time.
- Detect compliance and security violations across Infrastructure as Code to mitigate risk before provisioning cloud native infrastructure.
- Scan AWS CloudFormation templates for insecure configuration.
- Scan App Container and Docker containers for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.

Intentionally Vulnerable Applications
Intentionally vulnerable applications are often useful when developing security tests and tooling to provide a place you can run tests and make sure they fail correctly. These applications can also be useful for understanding how common vulnerabilities are introduced into applications and let you practice your skills at exploiting them.

It's not enough to test and harden our software in the lead up to a release. We must also monitor our production software for usage, performance and errors to capture malicious behavior and potential security flaws that we may need to respond to or address. A wide variety of tools are available to monitor different aspects of production software and infrastructure.
- A set of Content Security Policy tools that can test policies, monitor CSP reports and provide metrics and alerts.
- Embed privacy controls in your application code to detect and monitor PII as it enters and leaves your systems, preventing it from reaching unintended databases, data streams, or pipelines.
The software we write needs to use secrets (passwords, API keys, certificates, database connection strings) to access resources, yet we cannot store secrets within the codebase as this leaves them vulnerable to compromise. Secret management tools provide a means to securely store, access and manage secrets.

Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) tools scan software for vulnerabilities without executing the target software. Typically, static analysis will scan the source code for security flaws such as the use of unsafe functions, hard-coded secrets and configuration issues.
