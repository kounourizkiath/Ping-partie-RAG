Security settings in Elasticsearch | Reference
Security settings in Elasticsearch
enable anonymous access
and perform message authentication,
set up document and field level security
encrypt communications with SSL
audit security events
All of these settings can be added to the
configuration file, with the exception of the secure settings, which you add to the Elasticsearch keystore. For more information about creating and updating the Elasticsearch keystore, see
General security settings
xpack.security.enabled
, which enables Elasticsearch security features on the node. This setting must be enabled to use Elasticsearchâs authentication, authorization and audit features.
, security features are disabled, which is not recommended. It also affects all Kibana instances that connect to this Elasticsearch instance; you do not need to disable security features in those
files. For more information about disabling security features in specific Kibana instances, see
Kibana security settings
xpack.security.autoconfiguration.enabled
security auto configuration
, security auto configuration is disabled, which is not recommended. When disabled, security is not configured automatically when starting Elasticsearch for the first time, which means that you must
manually configure security
xpack.security.enrollment.enabled
. Controls enrollment (of nodes and Kibana) to a local node thatâs been
autoconfigured for security
, the local node can generate new enrollment tokens. Existing tokens can be used for enrollment if they are still valid.
The security autoconfiguration process will set this to
unless an administrator sets it to
before starting Elasticsearch.
xpack.security.hide_settings
) A comma-separated list of settings that are omitted from the results of the
cluster nodes info API
. You can use wildcards to include multiple settings in the list. For example, the following value hides all the settings for the ad1 active_directory realm:
xpack.security.authc.realms.active_directory.ad1.*
. The API already omits all
due to the sensitive nature of the information.
xpack.security.fips_mode.enabled
) Enables fips mode of operation. Set this to
if you run this Elasticsearch instance in a FIPS 140-2 enabled JVM. For more information, see
xpack.security.fips_mode.required_providers
) Optionally enforce specific Java JCE/JSSE security providers. For example, set this to
(case-insensitive) to require the Bouncy Castle FIPS JCE and JSSE security providers. Only applicable when
xpack.security.fips_mode.enabled
Password hashing settings

, an HTTP 401 response is returned and the user can provide credentials with the appropriate permissions to gain access. Defaults to
In places where the security features accept wildcard patterns (e.g. index patterns in roles, group matches in the role mapping API), each pattern is compiled into an Automaton. The follow settings are available to control this behaviour.
xpack.security.automata.max_determinized_states
) The upper limit on how many automaton states may be created by a single pattern. This protects against too-difficult (e.g. exponentially hard) patterns. Defaults to

xpack.security.dls_fls.enabled
to prevent document and field level security from being configured. Defaults to
xpack.security.dls.bitset.cache.ttl
) The time-to-live for cached
entries for document level security. Document level security queries may depend on Lucene BitSet objects, and these are automatically cached to improve performance. Defaults to expire entries that are unused for
xpack.security.dls.bitset.cache.size
) The maximum memory usage of cached
entries for document level security. Document level security queries may depend on Lucene BitSet objects, and these are automatically cached to improve performance. Can be configured as a raw number of bytes (such as
) or a percentage of the nodeâs JVM heap memory (such as
). When the default value is exceeded, the least recently used entries are evicted. Defaults to
of the heap assigned to the node.

xpack.security.authc.api_key.delete.retention_period
) Invalidated or expired API keys older than the retention period are eligible for deletion. Defaults to
Large real-time clock inconsistency across cluster nodes can cause problems with evaluating the API key retention period. That is, if the clock on the node invalidating the API key is significantly different than the one performing the deletion, the key may be retained for longer or shorter than the configured retention period.
xpack.security.authc.api_key.delete.interval
, Expert) Cluster nodes schedule the automatic deletion of invalidated or expired API keys that are older than the retention period. This setting controls the minimum time interval between two such deletion jobs. Defaults to
This is a low-level setting that currently controls the interval between deletion jobs triggered per-node, not across the cluster.

If the metadata resource is loaded from a file then the file must exist at node startup, if it does not exist then the node will fail to start. If the resource is loaded over HTTPS then (by default) the node will be tolerant of a failure to load the resource - the node will start and will continue to poll the URL for updates. The affected SAML realm will fail to authenticate users until the problem is resolved. To force the node to fail if the metadata is unavailable set

Under some circumstances Elasticsearch may determine that the metadata needs to be checked more frequently. This may occur if previous attempts to load the metadata encountered an error, or if the metadata indicates that it is due to expire in less than the configured refresh interval. In these cases Elasticsearch will poll more often, but never more frequently than

TLS/SSL key and trusted certificate settings
The following settings are used to specify a private key, certificate, and the trusted certificates that should be used when communicating over an SSL/TLS connection. If no trusted certificates are configured, the default certificates that are trusted by the JVM will be trusted along with the certificate(s) associated with a key in the same context. The key and certificate must be in place for connections that require client authentication or when acting as a SSL enabled server.
Storing trusted certificates in a PKCS#12 file, although supported, is uncommon in practice. The
elasticsearch-certutil
, as well as Javaâs
, are designed to generate PKCS#12 files that can be used both as a keystore and as a truststore, but this may not be the case for container files that are created using other tools. Usually, PKCS#12 files only contain secret and private entries. To confirm that a PKCS#12 container includes trusted certificate ("anchor") entries look for

Transport TLS/SSL settings
The settings in this section relate to node-to-node transport connections.
By default, Elasticsearch uses mutual TLS (mTLS) to secure node-to-node transport connections within a cluster. With mTLS, data is encrypted in transit and both nodes must present valid certificates when connecting. Each node requires that certificates be issued by a trusted certificate authority, ensuring that only authorized nodes can connect.
Learn about configuring node-to-node mTLS
Transport connections between Elasticsearch nodes are security-critical and you must protect them carefully. Malicious actors who can observe or interfere with unencrypted node-to-node transport traffic can read or modify cluster data. A malicious actor who can establish a transport connection might be able to invoke system-internal APIs, including APIs that read or modify cluster data.
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled
) Used to enable or disable TLS/SSL on the transport networking layer, which nodes use to communicate with each other. The default is
xpack.security.transport.ssl.supported_protocols
) Supported protocols with versions. Valid protocols:

xpack.security.transport.ssl.client_authentication
) Controls the node's behavior in regard to requesting a certificate when accepting an inbound transport connections from another Elasticsearch node. Valid values are
which means that the connecting node must present a valid client certificate during the connection process. May also be set to
which means that a client certificate is requested but the connecting node may choose not to present one, or
which means that no client certificate is even requested during the connection process.
Turning off mTLS by setting
xpack.security.transport.ssl.client_authentication
allows anyone with network access to establish transport connections. Malicious actors can use these connections to invoke system-internal APIs that might read or modify cluster data. Use mTLS to protect your node-to-node transport connections unless you are absolutely certain that unauthorized network access to these nodes cannot occur.
xpack.security.transport.ssl.verification_mode
) Defines how to verify the certificates presented by another party in the TLS connection:
:   Validates that the provided certificate: has an issue date thatâs within the
dates; chains to a trusted Certificate Authority (CA); has a

Furthermore, Elasticsearch supports authentication via securely-generated high entropy tokens, for instance
. Analogous to passwords, only the tokens' hashes are stored. Since the tokens are guaranteed to have sufficiently high entropy to resist offline attacks, secure salted hash functions are supported in addition to the password-hashing algorithms mentioned above.
