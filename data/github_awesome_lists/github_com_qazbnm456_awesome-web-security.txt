My Web Pentest Training is accepted by
🎉🎉🎉 Please come and join the course with me 🤓
To celebrate this unforgettable moment (and sorry for not updating the repo since a while), I'll do a complete revamp of all the contents of this long-lasting repository in the coming weeks to catch up with the knowledge and tricks that have happened over these years.
🐶 Curated list of Web Security materials and resources.
Needless to say, most websites suffer from various types of bugs which may eventually lead to vulnerabilities. Why would this happen so often? There can be many factors involved including misconfiguration, shortage of engineers' security skills, etc. To combat this, here is a curated list of Web Security materials and resources for learning cutting edge penetration techniques, and I highly encourage you to read this article "
So you want to be a web security researcher?
