OS Credential Dumping, Technique T1003 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
ATT&CK v18 has been released! Check out the
for more information.
OS Credential Dumping
Security Account Manager
Cached Domain Credentials
/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
Adversaries may attempt to dump credentials to obtain account login and credential material, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password. Credentials can be obtained from OS caches, memory, or structures.
Credentials can then be used to perform
and access restricted information.
Several of the tools mentioned in associated sub-techniques may be used by both adversaries and professional security testers. Additional custom tools likely exist as well.

Active Directory Configuration
Manage the access control list for "Replicating Directory Changes All" and other permissions associated with domain controller replication.
Consider adding users to the "Protected Users" Active Directory security group. This can help limit the caching of users' plaintext credentials.
Behavior Prevention on Endpoint
On Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to secure LSASS and prevent credential stealing.
Credential Access Protection
With Windows 10, Microsoft implemented new protections called Credential Guard to protect the LSA secrets that can be used to obtain credentials through forms of credential dumping. It is not configured by default and has hardware and firmware system requirements.
It also does not protect against all forms of credential dumping.
Encrypt Sensitive Information
Ensure Domain Controller backups are properly secured.
Operating System Configuration
Consider disabling or restricting NTLM.
Consider disabling WDigest authentication.
Ensure that local administrator accounts have complex, unique passwords across all systems on the network.
Privileged Account Management
Do not put user or admin domain accounts in the local administrator groups across systems unless they are tightly controlled, as this is often equivalent to having a local administrator account with the same password on all systems. Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers.
Scraping the passwords from memory requires root privileges. Follow best practices in restricting access to privileged accounts to avoid hostile programs from accessing such sensitive regions of memory.
Privileged Process Integrity
On Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, enable Protected Process Light for LSA.
Limit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts.
Credential Dumping via Sensitive Memory and Registry Access Correlation
Processes accessing LSASS memory or SAM registry hives outside of trusted security tools, often followed by file creation or lateral movement. Detects unauthorized access to sensitive OS subsystems for credential extraction.
Processes opening /proc/
/maps targeting credential-storing services like sshd or login. Behavior often includes high privilege escalation and memory inspection tools such as gcore or gdb.
Unsigned processes accessing system memory or launching known credential scraping tools (e.g., osascript, dylib injections) to access the Keychain or sensitive memory regions.
