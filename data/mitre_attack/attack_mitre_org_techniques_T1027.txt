Obfuscated Files or Information, Technique T1027 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
ATT&CK v18 has been released! Check out the
for more information.
Obfuscated Files or Information
Compile After Delivery
Indicator Removal from Tools
Dynamic API Resolution
Encrypted/Encoded File
Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit. This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.
Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection. These payloads may be used during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection. Sometimes a user's action may be required to open and
Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information
. The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary.
Adversaries may also use compressed or archived scripts, such as JavaScript.
Portions of files can also be encoded to hide the plain-text strings that would otherwise help defenders with discovery.
Payloads may also be split into separate, seemingly benign files that only reveal malicious functionality when reassembled.
Adversaries may also abuse
to obscure commands executed from payloads or directly via
Command and Scripting Interpreter
. Environment variables, aliases, characters, and other platform/language specific semantics can be used to evade signature based detections and application control mechanisms.

Anti-virus can be used to automatically detect and quarantine suspicious files. Consider utilizing the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) on Windows 10+ to analyze commands after being processed/interpreted.
Consider periodic review of common fileless storage locations (such as the Registry or WMI repository) to potentially identify abnormal and malicious data.

On Windows 10+, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent execution of potentially obfuscated payloads.
Ensure that a finite amount of ingress points to a software deployment system exist with restricted access for those required to allow and enable newly deployed software.
Behavioral Detection of Obfuscated Files or Information
Correlates script execution or suspicious parent processes with creation or modification of encoded, compressed, or encrypted file formats (e.g., .zip, .7z, .enc) and abnormal command-line syntax or PowerShell obfuscation.
Detects use of gzip, base64, tar, or openssl in scripts or commands that encode/encrypt files after file staging or system enumeration.
Monitors use of archive or encryption tools (zip, openssl) tied to user-scripted activity or binaries writing encoded payloads under /Users or /Volumes.
Identifies transfer of base64, uuencoded, or high-entropy files over HTTP, FTP, or custom protocols in lateral movement or exfiltration streams.
Detects encoded PowerCLI or Base64-encoded payloads staged via datastore uploads or shell access (e.g., ESXi Shell or backdoored VIBs).
