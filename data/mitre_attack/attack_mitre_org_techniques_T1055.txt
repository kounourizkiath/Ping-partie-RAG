Process Injection, Technique T1055 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
ATT&CK v18 has been released! Check out the
for more information.
Dynamic-link Library Injection
Portable Executable Injection
Thread Execution Hijacking
Asynchronous Procedure Call
Extra Window Memory Injection
Process Doppelgänging
Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
There are many different ways to inject code into a process, many of which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist for every major OS but are typically platform specific.
More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.

can inject code into a targeted process by writing to the remote memory of an infected system and then create a remote thread.
Behavior Prevention on Endpoint
Some endpoint security solutions can be configured to block some types of process injection based on common sequences of behavior that occur during the injection process. For example, on Windows 10, Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules may prevent Office applications from code injection.
Privileged Account Management
Utilize Yama (ex: /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope) to mitigate ptrace based process injection by restricting the use of ptrace to privileged users only. Other mitigation controls involve the deployment of security kernel modules that provide advanced access control and process restrictions such as SELinux, grsecurity, and AppArmor.
Behavioral Detection of Process Injection Across Platforms
Detects process injection by correlating memory manipulation API calls (e.g., VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory), suspicious thread creation (e.g., CreateRemoteThread), and unusual DLL loads within another process's context.
Detects ptrace- or memfd-based process injection through audit logs capturing system calls (e.g., ptrace, mmap) targeting running processes along with suspicious file descriptors or memory writes.
Detects memory-based injection by monitoring
, and dylib injection patterns through
DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES
or manual memory mapping.
