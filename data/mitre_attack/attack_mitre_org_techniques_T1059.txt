Command and Scripting Interpreter, Technique T1059 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
ATT&CK v18 has been released! Check out the
for more information.
Command and Scripting Interpreter
Windows Command Shell
Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, macOS and Linux distributions include some flavor of
while Windows installations include the
Windows Command Shell
There are also cross-platform interpreters such as
, as well as those commonly associated with client applications such as
Adversaries may abuse these technologies in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands. Commands and scripts can be embedded in
payloads delivered to victims as lure documents or as secondary payloads downloaded from an existing C2. Adversaries may also execute commands through interactive terminals/shells, as well as utilize various
in order to achieve remote Execution.
ESXi, IaaS, Identity Provider, Linux, Network Devices, Office Suite, Windows, macOS
downloaded and launched code within a SCT file.
has used COM scriptlets to download Cobalt Strike beacons.
has used Ruby scripts to execute payloads.
has utilized custom scripts to perform internal reconnaissance.
included the adversary executing command line interface (CLI) commands.
can support commands to execute Java-based payloads.
can create bind and reverse shells on the infected system.
is capable of performing remote command execution.
, threat actors used Perl scripts to enable the deployment of the THINSPOOL shell script dropper and for enumerating host data.
can execute various types of scripts on the victim’s machine.
can generate shellcode outputs that execute via Ruby.
has used the command line for execution.
uses a command-line interface to interact with systems.
scans processes on all victim systems in the environment and uses automated scripts to pull back the results.
has used scripting to iterate through a list of compromised PoS systems, copy data to a log file, and remove the original data files.
used SQL scripts to help perform tasks on the victim's machine.
can receive a command line argument to limit file encryption to specified directories.
has executed PHP and Shell scripts to identify and infect subsequent routers for the ORB network.
has used a Perl reverse shell to communicate with C2.
has the ability to run executables with command-line arguments.
is able to open a remote shell to execute commands.
has a CommandPromptPacket and ScriptPacket module(s) for creating a remote shell and executing scripts.
can run commands on the command-line interface.
can create a reverse shell between the infected host and a specified system.
is capable of providing Meterpreter shell access.
has utilized meterpreter shellcode.
has provided an arbitrary command execution interface.
has used various types of scripting for execution.
, the threat actors used Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) scripts to install malware.
has the ability to create reverse shells with Perl scripts.
variants can be delivered via highly obfuscated Windows Script Files (WSF) for initial execution.
has used the Windows Script Host (wscript) to execute intermediate files written to victim machines.
contains functionality to execute arbitrary commands passed to it.
has used the command line for execution of commands.
malware uses WMI to script data collection and command execution on the victim.
was delivered as a Java Archive (JAR) that runs by attaching itself to the Apache Tomcat Java servlet and web server.
has used a simple remote shell tool that will call back to the C2 server and wait for commands.
has used a Perl script for information gathering.
can create a reverse shell that utilizes statically-linked Wine cmd.exe code to emulate Windows command prompt commands.
used XLM 4.0 macros for initial code execution for malicious document files.
can receive command line arguments from an operator to corrupt the file system using the
can launch remote scripts on the victim’s machine.
Antivirus/Antimalware
Anti-virus can be used to automatically quarantine suspicious files.
Inventory systems for unauthorized command and scripting interpreter installations.
Behavior Prevention on Endpoint
On Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent
scripts from executing potentially malicious downloaded content
Where possible, only permit execution of signed scripts.
Disable or Remove Feature or Program
Disable or remove any unnecessary or unused shells or interpreters.
Use application control where appropriate. For example, PowerShell Constrained Language mode can be used to restrict access to sensitive or otherwise dangerous language elements such as those used to execute arbitrary Windows APIs or files (e.g.,
Limit Software Installation
Prevent user installation of unrequired command and scripting interpreters.
Privileged Account Management
When PowerShell is necessary, consider restricting PowerShell execution policy to administrators. Be aware that there are methods of bypassing the PowerShell execution policy, depending on environment configuration.
PowerShell JEA (Just Enough Administration) may also be used to sandbox administration and limit what commands admins/users can execute through remote PowerShell sessions.
Restrict Web-Based Content
Script blocking extensions can help prevent the execution of scripts and HTA files that may commonly be used during the exploitation process. For malicious code served up through ads, adblockers can help prevent that code from executing in the first place.
Behavioral Detection of Command and Scripting Interpreter Abuse
Detects the execution of scripting or command interpreters (e.g., powershell.exe, cmd.exe, wscript.exe) outside expected administrative time windows or from abnormal user contexts, often followed by encoded/obfuscated arguments or secondary execution events.
Detects use of shell interpreters (e.g., bash, sh, python, perl) initiated by users or processes not normally executing them, especially when chaining suspicious utilities like netcat, curl, or ssh.
Detects launch of command-line interpreters via Terminal, Automator, or hidden
, especially when parent process lineage deviates from user-initiated applications.
Detects use of 'esxcli system' or direct interpreter commands (e.g., busybox shell) invoked from SSH or host terminal unexpectedly.
Identifies CLI interpreter access (e.g., Cisco IOS, Juniper JUNOS) via
mode or scripting-capable sessions used by uncommon accounts or from unknown IPs.
