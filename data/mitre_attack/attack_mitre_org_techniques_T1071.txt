Application Layer Protocol, Technique T1071 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®
ATT&CK v18 has been released! Check out the
for more information.
Application Layer Protocol
File Transfer Protocols
Publish/Subscribe Protocols
Adversaries may communicate using OSI application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.
Adversaries may utilize many different protocols, including those used for web browsing, transferring files, electronic mail, DNS, or publishing/subscribing. For connections that occur internally within an enclave (such as those between a proxy or pivot node and other nodes), commonly used protocols are SMB, SSH, or RDP.
ESXi, Linux, Network Devices, Windows, macOS
has the ability to use Telnet for communication.
uses a custom command and control protocol that communicates over commonly used ports, and is frequently encapsulated by application layer protocols.
, the adversary initiated Layer Two Tunnelling Protocol (L2TP) connections to Moscow-based IP addresses.
has used an IRC channel for C2 communications.
has used valid accounts over RDP to connect to targeted systems.
can use the Stratum protocol on port 10001 for communication between the cryptojacking bot and the mining server.
malware has used IRC for C2.
Adversaries can also use
to establish an RDP connection with a controller over TCP/7519.
uses TCP and UDP communication for command and control traffic.
can use an inverse negotiated SSH connection as part of its C2.
is capable of contacting the TOR network for delivering second-stage payloads.
issued wget requests from infected systems to the C2.
connects to an IRC server for C2.
can utilize the Wireguard VPN protocol for command and control.
has used an IRC bot for C2 communications.
has used reverse SSH tunnels to communicate to victim devices.
Filter Network Traffic
Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic.
Network Intrusion Prevention
Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.
Detection of Command and Control Over Application Layer Protocols
Detects suspicious usage of common application-layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMB) by abnormal processes, with high outbound byte counts or irregular ports, possibly indicating command and control or data exfiltration.
Detects suspicious curl, wget, or custom socket traffic that leverages DNS, HTTPS, or IRC-style protocols with unbalanced traffic or beacon-like intervals.
Detects applications using abnormal protocols or high volume traffic not previously associated with the process image, such as Automator or AppleScript invoking curl or python sockets.
Detects application-layer tunneling or unauthorized app protocols like DNS-over-HTTPS, embedded C2 in TLS/HTTP headers, or misused SMB traffic crossing VLANs.
