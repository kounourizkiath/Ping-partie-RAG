OWASP Mobile Top 10 Methodology
This methodology report outlines the process we follow to update the OWASP Mobile Top 10 list of application security vulnerabilities using a data-based approach and unbiased sources.
To achieve this, we collect data from various sources such as incident reports, vulnerability databases, and security assessments, analyze the data, evaluate the sources for reliability and consistency, prioritize the vulnerabilities based on their impact and likelihood of occurrence, validate the results through consultation with experts and stakeholders, and create the final OWASP Top 10 list.
This report highlights the importance of following a comprehensive and unbiased approach to ensure the list reflects the most common and impactful mobile application security vulnerabilities, which can be used as a reference to improve the security of mobile applications.

To update the OWASP Top 10, we start by collecting data on the most common and impactful mobile application security vulnerabilities. We gather information from various sources such as incident reports, vulnerability databases, and security assessments. It’s essential to collect data from diverse sources to ensure that the data is comprehensive and unbiased. Some of the sources that can be used to collect data include:
Incident reports from companies, organizations, and government agencies
Vulnerability reports from security vendors and researchers
Publicly available datasets on mobile application security vulnerabilities
Surveys of security professionals or application developers
Once we have collected the data, the next step is to analyze it. We categorize the vulnerabilities, identify trends, and determine the severity of their impact. To analyze the data, we use statistical methods, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms. Some of the metrics that can be used to analyze the data include:
Frequency of occurrence
Complexity of exploitation
Prevalence in specific industries or regions
To ensure an unbiased approach, it’s important to evaluate the sources of the data used in the analysis. We evaluate the sources for reliability, consistency, and relevance by:
Checking the credibility and reputation of the sources
Evaluating the quality of the data
Verifying the data with multiple sources
Checking for potential biases in the data
Once we have analyzed the data, we prioritize the vulnerabilities based on their impact and likelihood of occurrence. This involves assigning a risk score to each vulnerability based on the following factors:
Likelihood of occurrence
Difficulty of remediation
Prevalence in specific industries or regions
To validate the results, we consult with experts in the field, review existing research and literature, and gather feedback from stakeholders. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, or interviews. Some of the questions we can ask to validate the results include:
Are the vulnerabilities identified in the list consistent with real-world incidents?
Do the vulnerabilities pose a significant threat to mobile applications?
Are there any vulnerabilities that are missing from the list?
Is the prioritization of the vulnerabilities appropriate?
Based on the analysis, prioritization, and validation, we create the final OWASP Top 10 list. The list includes the most impactful and prevalent mobile application security vulnerabilities, along with information on how to detect and mitigate them. The OWASP Top 10 list can be used as a reference for application developers, security professionals, and auditors to improve the security of their mobile applications.
