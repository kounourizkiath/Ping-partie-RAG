Server Side Request Forgery Prevention - OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Server-Side Request Forgery Prevention Cheat Sheet
The objective of the cheat sheet is to provide advices regarding the protection against
Server Side Request Forgery
This cheat sheet will focus on the defensive point of view and will not explain how to perform this attack. This
from the security researcher
provide techniques on how to perform this kind of attack.
SSRF is an attack vector that abuses an application to interact with the internal/external network or the machine itself. One of the enablers for this vector is the mishandling of URLs, as showcased in the following examples:
Image on an external server (
user enters image URL of their avatar for the application to download and use).
(users have to specify Webhook handlers or Callback URLs).
Internal requests to interact with another service to serve a specific functionality. Most of the times, user data is sent along to be processed, and if poorly handled, can perform specific injection attacks.
Overview of a SSRF common flow
SSRF is not limited to the HTTP protocol. Generally, the first request is HTTP, but in cases where the application itself performs the second request, it could use different protocols (
FTP, SMB, SMTP, etc.) and schemes (
If the application is vulnerable to
XML eXternal Entity (XXE) injection
then it can be exploited to perform a
to learn how to prevent the exposure to XXE.
Depending on the application's functionality and requirements, there are two basic cases in which SSRF can happen:
Application can send request only to
identified and trusted applications
approach is available.
Application can send requests to
ANY external IP address or domain name
approach is unavailable.
Because these two cases are very different, this cheat sheet will describe defences against them separately.
Case 1 - Application can send request only to identified and trusted applications
Sometimes, an application needs to perform a request to another application, often located on another network, to perform a specific task. Depending on the business case, user input is required for the functionality to work.
Take the example of a web application that receives and uses personal information from a user, such as their first name, last name, birth date etc. to create a profile in an internal HR system. By design, that web application will have to communicate using a protocol that the HR system understands to process that data.
Basically, the user cannot reach the HR system directly, but, if the web application in charge of receiving user information is vulnerable to SSRF, the user can leverage it to access the HR system.
The user leverages the web application as a proxy to the HR system.
The allowlist approach is a viable option since the internal application called by the
VulnerableApplication
is clearly identified in the technical/business flow. It can be stated that the required calls will only be targeted between those identified and trusted applications.
Available protections
Several protective measures are possible at the
principle, both layers will be hardened against such attacks.
The first level of protection that comes to mind is
Based on that point, the following question comes to mind:
How to perform this input validation?
, depending on the programming language used, parsers can be abused. One possible countermeasure is to apply the
when input validation is used because, most of the time, the format of the information expected from the user is globally known.
The request sent to the internal application will be based on the following information:
String containing business data.
IP address (V4 or V6).
Disable the support for the following of the
in your web client in order to prevent the bypass of the input validation described in the section
Exploitation tricks > Bypassing restrictions > Input validation > Unsafe redirect
In the context of SSRF, validations can be added to ensure that the input string respects the business/technical format expected.
can be used to ensure that data received is valid from a security point of view if the input data have a simple format (
token, zip code, etc.). Otherwise, validation should be conducted using the libraries available from the
object because regex for complex formats are difficult to maintain and are highly error-prone.
User input is assumed to be non-network related and consists of the user's personal information.
//Regex validation for a data having a simple format
"[a-zA-Z0-9\\s\\-]{1,50}"
//Continue the processing because the input data is valid
//Stop the processing and reject the request
In the context of SSRF, there are 2 possible validations to perform:
Ensure that the data provided is a valid IP V4 or V6 address.
Ensure that the IP address provided belongs to one of the IP addresses of the identified and trusted applications.
The first layer of validation can be applied using libraries that ensure the security of the IP address format, based on the technology used (library option is proposed here to delegate the managing of the IP address format and leverage battle-tested validation function):
Verification of the proposed libraries has been performed regarding the exposure to bypasses (Hex, Octal, Dword, URL and Mixed encoding) described in this
InetAddressValidator.isValid
Apache Commons Validator
to bypass using Hex, Octal, Dword, URL and Mixed encoding.

As allowlisting is used here, any bypass tentative will be blocked during the comparison against the allowed list of IP addresses.
to bypass using Hex, Octal, Dword, URL and Mixed encoding.
to bypass using Hex, Octal, Dword, URL and Mixed encoding.
Use the output value of the method/library as the IP address to compare against the allowlist.
After ensuring the validity of the incoming IP address, the second layer of validation is applied. An allowlist is created after determining all the IP addresses (v4 and v6 to avoid bypasses) of the identified and trusted applications. The valid IP is cross-checked with that list to ensure its communication with the internal application (string strict comparison with case sensitive).
In the attempt of validate domain names, it is apparent to do a DNS resolution to verify the existence of the domain. In general, it is not a bad idea, yet it opens up the application to attacks depending on the configuration used regarding the DNS servers used for the domain name resolution:
It can disclose information to external DNS resolvers.
It can be used by an attacker to bind a legit domain name to an internal IP address. See the section
Exploitation tricks > Bypassing restrictions > Input validation > DNS pinning
An attacker can use it to deliver a malicious payload to the internal DNS resolvers and the API (SDK or third-party) used by the application to handle the DNS communication and then, potentially, trigger a vulnerability in one of these components.
In the context of SSRF, there are two validations to perform:
Ensure that the data provided is a valid domain name.
Ensure that the domain name provided belongs to one of the domain names of the identified and trusted applications (the allowlisting comes to action here).
Similar to the IP address validation, the first layer of validation can be applied using libraries that ensure the security of the domain name format, based on the technology used (library option is proposed here in order to delegate the managing of the domain name format and leverage battle tested validation function):
Verification of the proposed libraries has been performed to ensure that the proposed functions do not perform any DNS resolution query.

has been tested but unfortunately they all consider
<script>alert(1)</script>.owasp.org
as a valid domain name.
This regex, taken from
^(((?!-))(xn--|_{1,1})?[a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9]{1,1}\.)*(xn--)?([a-z0-9][a-z0-9\-]{0,60}|[a-z0-9-]{1,30}\.[a-z]{2,})$
Example of execution of the proposed regex for Ruby:
"<script>alert(1)</script>"
"<script>alert(1)</script>.owasp.org"
/^(((?!-))(xn--|_{1,1})?[a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9]{1,1}\.)*(xn--)?([a-z0-9][a-z0-9\-]{0,60}|[a-z0-9-]{1,30}\.[a-z]{2,})$/
After ensuring the validity of the incoming domain name, the second layer of validation is applied:
Build an allowlist with all the domain names of every identified and trusted applications.
Verify that the domain name received is part of this allowlist (string strict comparison with case sensitive).
Unfortunately here, the application is still vulnerable to the
bypass mentioned in this
. Indeed, a DNS resolution will be made when the business code will be executed. To address that issue, the following action must be taken in addition of the validation on the domain name:
Ensure that the domains that are part of your organization are resolved by your internal DNS server first in the chains of DNS resolvers.
Monitor the domains allowlist in order to detect when any of them resolves to a/an:
- Local IP address (V4 + V6).
- Internal IP of your organization (expected to be in private IP ranges) for the domain that are not part of your organization.
The following Python3 script can be used, as a starting point, for the monitoring mentioned above:
# Dependencies: pip install ipaddress dnspython
# Configure the allowlist to check
# Configure the DNS resolver to use for all DNS queries
Verify if one of the DNS records resolve to a non public IP address.
Return a boolean indicating if any error has been detected.
# See https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html#ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_global
"[!] DNS record type '
" % (type, domain, value))
' is not valid IP address!"
Perform the check of the allowlist of domains.
Return a boolean indicating if any error has been detected.
# Get the IPs of the current domain
# See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types
# A = IPv4 address record
"[i] Cannot get A record for domain '
# AAAA = IPv6 address record
"[i] Cannot get AAAA record for domain '
# Verify the IPs obtained
Do not accept complete URLs from the user because URL are difficult to validate and the parser can be abused depending on the technology used as showcased by the following
If network related information is really needed then only accept a valid IP address or domain name.
The objective of the Network layer security is to prevent the
VulnerableApplication
from performing calls to arbitrary applications. Only allowed
will be available for this application in order to limit its network access to only those that it should communicate with.
The Firewall component, as a specific device or using the one provided within the operating system, will be used here to define the legitimate flows.
In the schema below, a Firewall component is leveraged to limit the application's access, and in turn, limit the impact of an application vulnerable to SSRF:
implementation advice
can also be leveraged and
is highly recommended in order to block illegitimate calls directly at network level itself
Case 2 - Application can send requests to ANY external IP address or domain name
This case happens when a user can control a URL to an
resource and the application makes a request to this URL (e.g. in case of
). Allow lists cannot be used here because the list of IPs/domains is often unknown upfront and is dynamically changing.

Thus, the call from the
Vulnerable Application

Uses a convention defined between the
VulnerableApplication
and the expected IP/domain in order to
that the call has been legitimately initiated.
Challenges in blocking URLs at application layer
Based on the business requirements of the above mentioned applications, the allowlist approach is not a valid solution. Despite knowing that the block-list approach is not an impenetrable wall, it is the best solution in this scenario. It is informing the application what it should
Here is why filtering URLs is hard at the Application layer:
It implies that the application must be able to detect, at the code level, that the provided IP (V4 + V6) is not part of the official
private networks ranges
addresses. Not every SDK provides a built-in feature for this kind of verification, and leaves the handling up to the developer to understand all of its pitfalls and possible values, which makes it a demanding task.
Same remark for domain name: The company must maintain a list of all internal domain names and provide a centralized service to allow an application to verify if a provided domain name is an internal one. For this verification, an internal DNS resolver can be queried by the application but this internal DNS resolver must not resolve external domain names.
Available protections
Taking into consideration the same assumption in the following

. Indeed, here we must use the block-list approach.
Regarding the proof of legitimacy of the request
that will receive the request must generate a random token (ex: alphanumeric of 20 characters) that is expected to be passed by the caller (in body via a parameter for which the name is also defined by the application itself and only allow characters set
) to perform a valid request. The receiving endpoint must only accept HTTP POST requests.
Validation flow (if one the validation steps fail then the request is rejected):
The application will receive the IP address or domain name of the
and it will apply the first validation on the input data using the libraries/regex mentioned in this
The second validation will be applied against the IP address or domain name of the
using the following block-list approach:
The application will verify that it is a public one (see the hint provided in the next paragraph with the python code sample).
The application will verify that it is a public one by trying to resolve the domain name against the DNS resolver that will only resolve internal domain name. Here, it must return a response indicating that it do not know the provided domain because the expected value received must be a public domain.

, the application will retrieve all the IP addresses behind the domain name provided (taking records
for IPv4 + IPv6) and it will apply the same verification described in the previous point about IP addresses.
The application will receive the protocol to use for the request via a dedicated input parameter for which it will verify the value against an allowed list of protocols (
The application will receive the parameter name for the token to pass to the
