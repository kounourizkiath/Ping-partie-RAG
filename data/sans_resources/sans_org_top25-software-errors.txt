Resources to Help Eliminate The Top 25 Software Errors
1. SANS Application Security Courses
The SANS Cloud Security curriculum seeks to ingrain security into the minds of every developer in the world by providing world-class educational resources to design, develop, procure, deploy, and manage secure software. The SANS cloud security and DevSecOps faculty are real-world practitioners with decades of application security experience. The concepts covered in our courses will be applicable to your software security program the day you return to work:
SEC522: Application Security: Securing Web Apps, APIs, and Microservices
SEC540: Cloud Security and DevSecOps Automation
SANS maintains an Application Security CyberTalent Assessment that measures secure coding skills and allow programmers to determine gaps in their knowledge of secure coding and allows buyers to ensure outsourced programmers have sufficient programming skills. Organizations can learn more at
https://www.sans.org/cybersecurity-assessments/application-security/
2. Developer Security Awareness Training
SANS Security Awareness Developer
product provides pinpoint software security awareness training on demand, all from the comfort of your desk. Application security awareness training includes over 30+ modules averaging 7-10 minutes in length to maximize learner engagement and retention. The modules cover the full breadth and depth of topics for PCI Section 6.5 compliance and the items that are important for secure software development.
3. The TOP 25 Errors List will be updated regularly and will be posted at both the SANS and MITRE sites
CWE Top 25 Software Errors Site
MITRE maintains the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) web site, with the support of the US Department of Homeland Security's National Cyber Security Division, presenting detailed descriptions of the top 25 Software errors along with authoritative guidance for mitigating and avoiding them. That site also contains data on more than 700 additional Software errors, design errors and architecture errors that can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities. CWE Web Site
The Software Assurance Forum for Excellence in Code (members include EMC, Juniper, Microsoft, Nokia, SAP and Symantec) has produced two excellent publications outlining industry best practices for software assurance and providing practical advice for implementing proven methods for secure software development.
Fundamental Practices for Secure Software Development 3rd Edition
https://safecode.org/publications/#safecodepublications-2362
Overview of Software Integrity Controls
https://safecode.org/publications/#safecodepublications-189
Framework for Software Supply Chain Integrity
https://safecode.org/publications/#safecodepublications-188
Fundamental Practices for Secure Software Development
https://safecode.org/publications/#safecodepublications-186
Software Assurance: An Overview of Current Industry Best Practices
https://safecode.org/publications/#safecodepublications-185
5. Software Assurance Community Resources Site and DHS web sites
As part of DHS risk mitigation efforts to enable greater resilience of cyber assets, the Software Assurance Program seeks to reduce software vulnerabilities, minimize exploitation, and address ways to routinely acquire, develop and deploy reliable and trustworthy software products with predictable execution, and to improve diagnostic capabilities to analyze systems for exploitable weaknesses.
6. Nearly a dozen software companies offer automated tools that test programs for these errors.
How Important Are the Top 25 Software Errors?
Just wanted to commend the depth of the CWE/SANS Top 25. The code examples are particularly excellent. I have asked all my developers to read one of these each day for the next 25 days. I'm taking my own advice as well, and even though I'm still reading some of the "easy" ones (like SQL injection), I still find that I am learning new things about old topics.
The Top 25 provides much needed guidance for software developers focusing on eliminating software security defects in their products. If you're involved with software development at your organization and are looking to improve your product security posture, you need to read this.
It's great to see the CWE/SANS Top 25 list continue to be maintained and mature. Relentlessly spreading the word about the most common security defects in programming is a vital need. The state of security in our software would without a doubt be much improved if everyone who touches software development reads and thoroughly understands this. Kudos.
