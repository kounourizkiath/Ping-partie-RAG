Cybrary is just an amazing platform. Literally thousands of hours of quality content. You can find a course or a lab for just about everything, and they are constantly releasing new material. They also have highly responsive customer service. It's been worth every penny.
Greatest investment I have made to dateCybrary is solely responsible for my passing the CompTIA A+ exam and is the reason I am going into my Net+ with confidence. I have learned a great deal through virtual labs, practice tests, recorded lessons, and the various other things they offer. The community is great as well. Got a question about the interview process for a tech job? Ask in discord. Just got a cert? Post it in discord and let the reactions and comments flow making you feel great about yourself. It is an all around wonderful experience and I rate it as a totally worthwile expense for starting or furthering your career in the IT industry. Invest in yourself.
Training is coolEasy to enroll, instructors are enthusiastic and professionnal, technical stuff is very well explained.
I've been having concerns on how to start in terms of building my #cybercareer with a sustained path. So I got introduced to Cybrary and I was able to enroll and startup early last week and I have gone through two sessions, getting to know Cybrary and also a view of what cybersecurity is from their perspective. That gave me an overall view of what jobs are found in the space, their general responsibilities, required skills, necessary certifications and their average salary pay... Cybrary has given me a greater reason to pursue my hearts desire at all cost.
Thanks to Cybrary I'm now a more complete professional! Everyone in [the] cybersecurity area should consider enrollment in any Cybrary courses.
IT Administrator - CISSP
The interviewer said the certifications and training I had completed on my own time showed that I was a quick learner, and they gave me a job offer.
Our partnership with Cybrary has given us the opportunity to provide world-class training materials at no cost to our clients, thanks to the funding we’ve received from the government. Cybrary offers a proven method for building a more skilled cybersecurity workforce.
All of the knowledge, skills, and abilities gained through the program were essential to me impressing the employer during the interview.
Senior Security Analyst
Cybrary is a one-stop-shop for my cybersecurity learning needs. Courses on vulnerability management, threat intelligence, and SIEM solutions were key for my early roles. As I grow into leadership roles influencing business policy, I’m confident Cybrary will continue developing the knowledge and skills I need to succeed.
Senior Cybersecurity Consultant and Virtual CISO
After tens of minutes, I proudly have achieved my certificate of continuing education for Intro to Infosec... Doing everything I can to avoid retaking the CISSP test! Thanks Cybrary - 1 CPE at a time!
We’ve had six students this summer, all with different schedules, so we’ve been trying to balance their learning experience with some practical work. It’s not like they’re all sitting in a classroom at the same time, so the ability for them to learn at their own pace without any additional support has probably been the biggest benefit of using Cybrary.
