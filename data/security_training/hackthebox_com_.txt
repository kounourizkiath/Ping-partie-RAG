Since we introduced Hack The Box, the team can now quickly learn the theoretical and practical sides of penetration testing with very in-depth and up-to-date materials. To spice up the learning, we have a "Hacker of the Month" where we recognize the most progressive employee in our lab environment.
Information Security Analyst, PUMA SE
Hack The Box has been an invaluable resource in developing and training our team. The content is extremely engaging through the gamified approach and the pace at which new and high quality content is updated ensures our team's skills are always sharp. The labs offer a breadth of technical challenge and variety, unparalleled anywhere else in the market.
Lead Security Consultant, Context
Hack The Box has been great for recruitment to quickly establish the caliber of ethical hacking candidates . The platform provides a credible overview of a professional's skills and ability when selecting the right hire. An active HTB profile strengthens a candidate's position in the job market, making them stand out from the crowd and highlighting their commitment to skill development.
UK Team Lead, Adeptis
My team and I used Professional Labs from Hack The Box to get used to the new trends of the Red Team concept. After a lot of positive frustration, dedication, and self-study we managed to finish the challenge and leave with much more knowledge than we had before. I strongly recommend this service to teams composed of dedicated persons, who love the technical aspects of penetration testing and also enjoy assisted self-study.
Lead Penetration Tester, SIEMENS
Our offensive security team was looking for a real-world training platform to test advanced attack tactics. We couldn't be happier with the Professional Labs environment. The lab was fully dedicated, so we didn't share the environment with others. The HTB support team has been excellent to make the training fit our needs.
Head of Offensive Security, NortonLifeLock
The best defense is a good offensive mindset. Hack The Box has enabled our security engineers a deeper understanding on how adversaries work in a real world environment. I provided a learn-at-your-own-pace training experience for my team and track progress towards agreed upon goals. Their knowledge of exploitation, privilege escalation, and system enumeration has grown exponentially since purchasing HTB.
Information Security Professional, Amedisys
As defenders, it would be a great mistake to think that offensive knowledge is not a must-have in our skillset. HTB Academy helps our team gain that knowledge at their own pace, by providing quality and easy-to-follow content. From the curious software engineer to our best analysts, custom learning paths allow us to build the best experience for every kind of security enthusiast.
L3 SOC Analyst, Dassault Systemes
Deployment of boxes on the Hack The Box Enterprise Platform is as easy as pressing a button and within one minute, the box is available. By making use of the Enterprise platform and Hack The Box Academy, we have been able to onboard new joiners more efficiently and promote internal mobility for our security assessments team.
