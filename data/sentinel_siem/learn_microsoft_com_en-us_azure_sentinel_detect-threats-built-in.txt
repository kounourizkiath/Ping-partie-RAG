setting up Microsoft Sentinel to collect data from all over your organization
, you need to constantly dig through all that data to detect security threats to your environment. To accomplish this task, Microsoft Sentinel provides threat detection rules that run regularly, querying the collected data and analyzing it to discover threats. These rules come in a few different flavors and are collectively known as
when they find what theyâre looking for. Alerts contain information about the events detected, such as the
(users, devices, addresses, and other items) involved. Alerts are aggregated and correlated into
âcase filesâthat you can
assign and investigate
to learn the full extent of the detected threat and respond accordingly. You can also build predetermined, automated responses into the rules' own configuration.
You can create these rules from scratch, using the
built-in analytics rule wizard
. However, Microsoft strongly encourages you to make use of the vast array of
analytics rule templates
available to you through the many
solutions for Microsoft Sentinel
provided in the content hub. These templates are pre-built rule prototypes, designed by teams of security experts and analysts based on their knowledge of known threats, common attack vectors, and suspicious activity escalation chains. You activate rules from these templates to automatically search across your environment for any activity that looks suspicious. Many of the templates can be customized to search for specific types of events, or filter them out, according to your needs.
This article helps you understand how Microsoft Sentinel detects threats, and what happens next.
Microsoft Sentinel is generally available in the Microsoft Defender portal
, including for customers without Microsoft Defender XDR or an E5 license.
, all customers using Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal will be
redirected to the Defender portal and will use Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal only
, many new customers are
automatically onboarded and redirected to the Defender portal
If you're still using Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal, we recommend that you start planning your
transition to the Defender portal
to ensure a smooth transition and take full advantage of the
unified security operations experience offered by Microsoft Defender
. For more information, see

, a special rule type described later in this article.
To find more rule templates than are currently displayed, go to the
in Microsoft Sentinel to install the related product solutions or standalone content. Analytics rule templates are available with nearly every product solution in the content hub.
The following types of analytics rules and rule templates are available in Microsoft Sentinel:
Near-real-time (NRT) rules
Microsoft security rules
Besides the preceding rule types, there are some other specialized template types that can each create one instance of a rule, with limited configuration options:
Advanced multistage attack detection ("Fusion")
Machine learning (ML) behavior analytics
By far the most common type of analytics rule,
that are configured to run at regular intervals and examine raw data from a defined "lookback" period. If the number of results captured by the query passes the threshold configured in the rule, the rule produces an alert.
scheduled rule templates
were written by security and data science experts, either from Microsoft or from the vendor of the solution providing the template. Queries can perform complex statistical operations on their target data, revealing baselines and outliers in groups of events.
The query logic is displayed in the rule configuration. You can use the query logic and the scheduling and lookback settings as defined in the template, or customize them to create new rules. Alternatively, you can create
entirely new rules from scratch
Scheduled analytics rules in Microsoft Sentinel
Near-real-time (NRT) rules
NRT rules are a limited subset of
. They are designed to run once every minute, in order to supply you with information as up-to-the-minute as possible.
They function mostly like scheduled rules and are configured similarly, with some limitations.
Quick threat detection with near-real-time (NRT) analytics rules in Microsoft Sentinel
Anomaly rules use machine learning to observe specific types of behaviors over a period of time to determine a baseline. Each rule has its own unique parameters and thresholds, appropriate to the behavior being analyzed. After the observation period is completed, the baseline is set. When the rule observes behaviors that exceed the boundaries set in the baseline, it flags those occurrences as anomalous.
While the configurations of out-of-the-box rules can't be changed or fine-tuned, you can duplicate a rule, and then change and fine-tune the duplicate. In such cases, run the duplicate in
mode and the original concurrently in
mode. Then compare results, and switch the duplicate to
if and when its fine-tuning is to your liking.
Anomalies don't necessarily indicate malicious or even suspicious behavior by themselves. Therefore, anomaly rules don't generate their own alerts. Rather, they record the results of their analysisâthe detected anomaliesâin the
table. You can query this table to provide context that improves your detections, investigations, and threat hunting.

Microsoft security rules
While scheduled and NRT rules automatically create incidents for the alerts they generate, alerts generated in external services and ingested to Microsoft Sentinel don't create their own incidents. Microsoft security rules automatically create Microsoft Sentinel incidents from the alerts generated in other Microsoft security solutions, in real time. You can use Microsoft security templates to create new rules with similar logic.

Take advantage of threat intelligence produced by Microsoft to generate high fidelity alerts and incidents with the

Advanced multistage attack detection (Fusion)
Microsoft Sentinel uses the
Fusion correlation engine
, with its scalable machine learning algorithms, to detect advanced multistage attacks by correlating many low-fidelity alerts and events across multiple products into high-fidelity and actionable incidents. The
Advanced multistage attack detection
rule is enabled by default. Because the logic is hidden and therefore not customizable, there can be only one rule with this template.
The Fusion engine can also correlate alerts produced by
scheduled analytics rules
with alerts from other systems, producing high-fidelity incidents as a result.

for additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
Machine learning (ML) behavior analytics
Take advantage of Microsoft's proprietary machine learning algorithms to generate high fidelity alerts and incidents with the
ML Behavior Analytics
rules. These unique rules (currently in
) aren't customizable, but when enabled, detect specific anomalous SSH and RDP login behaviors based on IP and geolocation and user history information.
Access permissions for analytics rules
When you create an analytics rule, an access permissions token is applied to the rule and saved along with it. This token ensures that the rule can access the workspace that contains the data queried by the rule, and that this access is maintained even if the rule's creator loses access to that workspace.
There is one exception to this access, however: when a rule is created to access workspaces in other subscriptions or tenants, such as what happens in the case of an MSSP, Microsoft Sentinel takes extra security measures to prevent unauthorized access to customer data. For these kinds of rules, the credentials of the user that created the rule are applied to the rule instead of an independent access token, so that when the user no longer has access to the other subscription or tenant, the rule stops working.
If you operate Microsoft Sentinel in a cross-subscription or cross-tenant scenario, when one of your analysts or engineers loses access to a particular workspace, any rules created by that user stops working. In this situation, you get a health monitoring message regarding "insufficient access to resource", and the rule is
after having failed a certain number of times.
Export rules to an ARM template
export your rule to an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template
if you want to manage and deploy your rules as code. You can also import rules from template files in order to view and edit them in the user interface.
