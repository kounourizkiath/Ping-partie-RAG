Statistical and Charting Functions
Statistical and charting functions
You can use the statistical and charting functions with the
Support for related commands
The functions can also be used with related statistical and charting commands. The following table lists the commands supported by the statistical and charting functions and the related command that can also use these functions.
Supported related commands
commands, see the documentation for each command for a list of the supported functions.
Functions that you can use to create sparkline charts are noted in the documentation for each function. Sparkline is a function that applies to only the
commands, and allows you to call other functions. For more information, see
Add sparklines to search results
How field values are processed
Most of the statistical and charting functions expect the field values to be numbers.  All of the values are processed as numbers, and any non-numeric values are ignored.
The following functions process the field values as literal string values, even though the values are numbers.
For example, you use the
function and the field contains values such as "1", "1.0", and "01".  Each value is considered a distinct string value.
The only exceptions are the
functions.  These functions process values as numbers if possible. For example, the values  "1", "1.0", and "01" are processed as the same numeric value.
Supported functions and syntax
There are two ways that you can see information about the supported statistical and charting functions:

The following table is a quick reference of the supported statistical and charting functions, organized by category. This table  provides a brief description for each functions. Use the links in the table to learn more about each function and to see examples.
Supported functions and syntax
Returns the average of the values in the field specified.
Returns the number of occurrences where the field that you specify contains any value (is not empty). You can also count the occurrences of a specific value in the field by using the
function. For example:
count( eval(field_name="value"))
distinct_count(<value>)
Returns the count of distinct values in the field specified.
Returns the estimated count of the distinct values in the field specified.
Returns the theoretical error of the estimated count of the distinct values in the field specified. The error represents a ratio of the
absolute_value(estimate_distinct_count - real_distinct_count)/real_distinct_count
exactperc<percentile>(<value>)
Returns a percentile value of the numeric field specified. Provides the exact value, but is very resource expensive for high cardinality fields. An alternative is
Returns the maximum value in the field specified. If the field values are non-numeric, the maximum value is found using lexicographical ordering. This function processes field values as numbers if possible, otherwise processes field values as strings.
Returns the arithmetic mean of the values in the field specified.
Returns the middle-most value of the values in the field specified.
Returns the minimum value in the field specified. If the field values are non-numeric, the minimum value is found using lexicographical ordering.
Returns the most frequent value in the field specified.
percentile<percentile>(<value>)
Returns the N-th percentile value of all the values in the numeric field specified.  Valid field values are integers from 1 to 99.
Additional percentile functions are
upperperc<percentile>(<value>)
exactperc<percentile>(<value>)
If the field values are numeric, returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the field specified.
Returns the sample standard deviation of the values in the field specified.
Returns the population standard deviation of the values in the field specified.
Returns the sum of the values in the field specified.
Returns the sum of the squares of the values in the field specified.
upperperc<percentile>(<value>)
Returns an approximate percentile value, based on the requested percentile of the numeric field.
When there are more than 1000 values, the upperperc function gives the approximate upper bound for the percentile requested. Otherwise the upperperc function returns the same percentile as the
Returns the sample variance of the values in the field specified.
Returns the population variance of the values in the field specified.
Event order functions
Returns the first seen value in a field. In general, the first seen value of the field is the most recent instance of this field, relative to the input order of events into the stats command.
Returns the last seen value in a field. In general, the last seen value of the field is the oldest instance of this field relative to the input order of events into the stats command.
Multivalue stats and chart functions
Returns a list of up to 100 values in a field as a multivalue entry. The order of the values reflects the order of input events.
Returns the list of all distinct values in a field as a multivalue entry. The order of the values is lexicographical.
Returns the chronologically earliest (oldest) seen occurrence of a value in a field.
earliest_time(<value>)
Returns the UNIX time of the earliest (oldest) occurrence of a value of the field. Used in conjunction with the
functions to calculate the rate of increase for an accumulating counter.
Returns the chronologically latest (most recent) seen occurrence of a value in a field.
Returns the UNIX time of the latest (most recent) occurrence of a value of the field. Used in conjunction with the
functions to calculate the rate of increase for an accumulating counter.
Returns the values in a field or eval expression for each day.
Returns the values in a field or eval expression for each hour.
Returns the values in a field or eval expression for each minute.
Returns the values in a field or eval expression for each second.
Returns the per-second rate change of the value of the field. Represents
(latest - earliest) / (latest_time - earliest_time)
values of the field to be numerical, and the
values to be different.
Returns the average rates for the time series associated with a specified accumulating counter metric.
Returns the summed rates for the time series associated with a specified accumulating counter metric.
