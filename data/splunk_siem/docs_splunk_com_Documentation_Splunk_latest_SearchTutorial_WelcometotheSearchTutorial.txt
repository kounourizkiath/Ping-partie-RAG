Already have access to Splunk software?
For this tutorial, use a free Trial version of the Splunk software.
Why?  Because this tutorial uses a specific set of data to ensure consistency in your search results and the features that you are learning about. In the tutorial, you will upload this tutorial-specific data to the Splunk platform. You might not have permission to upload data in your production, work environment.  Additionally, using a free Trial version of the software ensures that the tutorial data is not mixed in with your work data.
The Trial version of the software converts to a Free version after 30 days. If you have a Free version of the Splunk software, some of the features, such as changing Preferences in the User account menu, are not available. See
The steps for downloading a free Trial version of Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud Platform are described in the tutorial.
