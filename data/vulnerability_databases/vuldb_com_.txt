Mozilla Firefox Access API use after free
A vulnerability described as
has been identified in
Mozilla Firefox up to 146.0.0
. This impacts an unknown function of the component
. Such manipulation leads to use after free.
This vulnerability is uniquely identified as
. The attack can be launched remotely. No exploit exists.
Upgrading the affected component is recommended.
[Feature]  Introduction of the languages
Cyber Threat Intelligence
aims to determine the ongoing research of
to anticipiate their acitivities. The CTI team is mapping structures of
and their relationships to identify tensions and possible attack scenarios. Observing exploit markets on the Darknet, discussions of vulnerabilities on mailinglists, and social media exchanges makes it possible to identify planned attacks. The
Threat Intelligence Platform
(TIP) illustrates the interest of cybercriminals and state actors in real-time.

The moderation team is monitoring different sources 24/7 for the disclosure of information about new or existing vulnerabilitities. If a new issue is determined, additional data from other sources is collected and a new VulDB entry created. This entry is then pushed to customers, the web site and accessible via API and social media accounts. Please use the
to suggest new sources and entries.

If the moderation team detects changes of existing vulnerabilities or new data of existing vulnerabilities are getting published, the old entries will be updated. This happens if needed and on a regular basis which concludes in a maximum of data quality. Every entry contains a timestamp of the last update and a change log of updated fields. Please use the edit feature to commit updates to existing entries.

Top vulnerabilities with the highest
at the moment. The score is generated by separate values which are called vectors. Those vectors define the structure of the vulnerability. They rely on attack prerequisites and impact. The calculated score ranges between 0.0 and 10.0 whereas a high value declares a high risk. The main score is the base score which analyses the structure of the vulnerability only. The extended score called temp score introduces time-based aspects like exploit and countermeasure availability. Our moderators classify every entry to generate a CVSS score as accurate as posible.

Top vulnerabilities with the highest
at the moment. These price estimations are calculated prices based on mathematical algorithm. This algorithm got developed by our specialists over the years by observing the exploit market structure and exchange behavior of involved actors. It allows the prediction of generic prices by considering multiple technical aspects of the affected vulnerability. The more technical details are available the higher the accuracy of the reproducable approximation.

Exploits are small tools or larger frameworks which help to exploit a vulnerability or even fully automate the exploitation. The development of exploits takes time and effort which is why an exploit market exists. By observing the market structure it is possible to determine current and to forecast future prices. This information might influence a risk assessment.
