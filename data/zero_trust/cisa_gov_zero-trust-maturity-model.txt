Zero Trust Maturity Model
Zero trust provides a collection of concepts and ideas designed to minimize uncertainty in enforcing accurate, least privilege per-request access decisions in information systems and services in the face of a network viewed as compromised. The goal is to prevent unauthorized access to data and services and make access control enforcement as granular as possible. Zero trust presents a shift from a location-centric model to a more data-centric approach for fine-grained security controls between users, systems, data and assets that change over time; for these reasons. This provides the visibility needed to support the development, implementation, enforcement, and evolution of security policies. More fundamentally, zero trust may require a change in an organization’s philosophy and culture around cybersecurity.
CISA's Zero Trust Maturity Model Version 2.0
Zero Trust Maturity Model
is one of many roadmaps that agencies can reference as they transition towards a zero trust architecture. The maturity model aims to assist agencies in the development of zero trust strategies and implementation plans and to present ways in which various CISA services can support zero trust solutions across agencies.
The maturity model, which includes five pillars and three cross-cutting capabilities, is based on the foundations of zero trust. Within each pillar, the maturity model provides specific examples of traditional, initial, advanced, and optimal zero trust architectures.
Version 1.0 of the ZTMM opened for public comment in September 2021. The
Response to Comments for Zero Trust Maturity Model
summarizes the comments and modifications in response to version 1.0 feedback.
Version 2.0 incorporates alignment to OMB M-22-09, published in January 2022.
